QSCCBoard License terms
----------

I usually advocate for a hands-off BSD style license, but in this case, I want something different.

This program, the constituant source, documentation and license, described as variations of "THIS PROGRAM", "THE PROGRAM", "THIS PROJECT", and "THE PROJECT", together in whole, and or in part, are licensed to anyone who obtains a copy, with the following stipulations;

* THIS PROGRAM is Copyright by Neal Horman and the QSCCBoard project. Portions of contributions may be Copyright by the orignal author(s) and or content creator(s) and are noted as such in the invidual files / documents.
* Copyright and contribution attributions may not be removed.
* THIS PROGRAM may be used, and extened by anyone, and may be redistributed, only as a whole. ie. Binary and the constituent parts, together.
* No one may "sell" THIS PROGRAM.
* Anyone may use THIS PROGRAM as an integral part of their internal business operations for the purpose for which it is written.
* Alterations, enhancements, or extentions of THIS PROGRAM, must be submitted back to THE PROJECT for potential inclusion, under the same licensing terms. I want to keep THE PROJECT strictly out in the open, so that everone benefits from it.
