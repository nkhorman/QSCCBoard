QSCCBoard License terms
----------

I usually advocate for a hands-off BSD style license, but in this case, I want something different.

This program, the constituant source and documentation (here-in defined as "THIS PROGRAM", "THE PROGRAM", "THIS PROJECT", and "THE PROJECT"), in whole, and in part, are licensed to anyone who obtains a copy, with the following stipulations;

* THIS PROGRAM may be used, and extened by anyone, and may be redistributed, only as a whole. ie. Binary and the constituent source and documentation, together.
* No one may "sell" THIS PROGRAM.
* Anyone may use THIS PROGRAM as an integral part of their internal business operations for the purpose for which it is written.
* Alterations, enhancements, or extentions of THIS PROGRAM, must be submitted back to THE PROJECT for potential inclusion, under the same licensing terms. I want to keep THE PROJECT strctly out in the open, so that everone benefits from it.
